  <div class="image-text">3. Pompeii was rediscovered in the 18th century. In 1738, workers found the nearby town of Herculaneum while building a palace for King Charles III of Spain. This sparked interest in ancient Roman cities. In 1748, a farmer uncovered ancient buildings in his vineyard, leading to formal excavations of Pompeii. Early digs, led by Rocque Joaquin de Alcubierre, focused on finding treasures rather than preserving the site, causing some damage.</div>
